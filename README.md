### Hi there 👋 I'm Salim Ben Hammadi,

I am a passionate Machine learning student 🚀 familiar with all different forms of data modelling and how to constantly evaluate and analyse them to make sense of them. Also familiar with gathering, cleaning, and organizing data :robot: . with an advanced understanding of statistical, algebraic, and other analytical techniques :new:.

- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing **ICT Engineering degree at the University of Padua**
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I **strongly** believe in the *Chaos theory*: Even in unpredictable environments with seemingly random oddities and irregularities lies a predictable & sensible pattern not seen initially.
- :bulb: I'm interested in all things data: **Big Data, Cloud, Machine Learning and Data Science**

- 💬 Talk to me about Memes, Anime, Movies 🎥, Amateur Photography 📸
